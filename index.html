                    An ultramarathon, also called ultra distance or ultra running, is any footrace longer than the traditional marathon length of 42.195 kilometres (26 mi 385 yd).
                    There are two main types of ultramarathon events: those that cover a specified distance or route, and those that last for a 
                    predetermined period of time (with the winner covering the most distance in that time). The most common 
                    distances are 50 kilometres (31.07 mi), 100 kilometres (62.14 mi), 50 miles (80.47 km), and 100 miles 
                    (160.93 km), although many races have other distances.
